Description: The Hybrid design is a combination of model-assisted design (e.g., the modified 
             Toxicity Probability Interval design) with dose-toxicity model-based design for 
             phase I dose-finding studies. The hybrid design controls the overdosing 
             toxicity well and leads to a recommended dose closer to the true maximum tolerated 
             dose (MTD) due to its ability to calibrate for an intermediate dose. More details 
             can be found in Liao et al. 2022 <doi:10.1002/ijc.34203>.
